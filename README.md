### Experience
***JULY 2023 - PRESENT***
#### Data Science Associate Consultant | ZS Associates | Bengaluru
- Recent project was focussed on fraud detection in clinical trials, which has now been integrated into an automated pipeline scheduled to run monthly. The system identifies fabrications and anomalies within clinical trial data, providing risk signals to the internal audit team. The current pipeline significantly enhances the ability to gauge risk signals more effectively and in a faster, structured manner for early intervention and analysis. The improvement bolsters the confidence in the data submitted for clinical trials and results in substantial time and cost savings for the organisation.
confidence of data submitted for clinical trials.
- Worked on implementing a solution using LLMs which can improve performance and speed of translating queries used for quality checks across multiple real-world datasets, eliminating the intermediate step of using common data models.
- Implemented a solution using a transformer-based model and K-Means clustering which can identify intricate patient journeys within a therapeutic area, uncovering insights on nuanced journeys that can help pharmaceutical brands target the most relevant patient population.
- Secured global second place, in the patient prediction challenge hosted by PrecisionFDA for predicting heart failures and hospital readmissions for US veterans. The first phase of the challenge was evaluated on synthetic data where the top performing solutions were evaluated on real-world data behind FDA firewalls.
- Utilized time-series models (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA and LSTM) to forecast demand quantities, for optimizing market cost and improve supply chain efficiency.

***FEBRUARY 2023 – JUNE 2023***
#### Data Science Associate | ZS Associates | Bengaluru
- Developed a solution using hierarchical density-based clustering and BERT embeddings to extract key attributes from user reviews for multiple brands of beers. Implemented a scoring metric using sentiment analysis to identify popular brands based on the reviews.
- Analyzed claims data to generate metrics for identifying key healthcare providers and organizations which can be targeted by the brand to enable tailored digital therapies for rare mental disorders.
- Worked on EMR data to build a data quality framework utilizing business rules and anomaly detection modules. This helped identify data quality issues across univariate, multivariate, and temporal spaces. Implemented a subspace-monitoring based algorithm which can help detect temporal anomalies in sparse, irregular time series.

***NOV 2023 –JANUARY 2023***
#### Decision Analytics Associate | ZS Associates | Bengaluru
- Worked on the proof of concept for “prospective support arm” where the idea was to generate a synthetic arm using real-world EMR data which can help prospectively monitor patient characteristics based on the usage of different medications. This can help save millions of dollars during clinical trials and expedite the drug development phases by providing real-time insights for the patient characteristics for primary care medications within the therapeutic area.
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of disease prevalence, comorbid conditions, treatment landscape and physician specialties leveraging claims data to identify lucrative market opportunities for a top pharmaceutical brand.
- Developed a disambiguation methodology using fuzzy-matching, NER taggings and business rules to identify influential key opinion leaders within different therapeutic areas for strategic decision-making and marketing efforts.

***JUNE 2019 – AUGUST 2020***
#### Application Development Associate (SAP ABAP) | Accenture| Kolkata
- Developed tools for large data migration from client to SAP systems using LSMW and LTMC.
- Implemented ABAP report programs for analyzing work breakdown structures in SAP systems.
- Developed a report program for error identification during mass data transfers.
